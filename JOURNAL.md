## 10/30/2025 - Created matrix in schematic.  

Started project by making the schematic file. Created the switch matrix and started assigning footprints for switches with gateron hotswap sockets and sod123 diodes.

## 10/31/2025 - Created KiCad PCB, added a rotary encoder  

I moved schematic into a pcb. Using kb placer. After creating a 3x3 matrix of the keys and routing them, I realized I had more pins I could use. I added a new rotary encoder switch to the matrix, making a 4th column. This required me to download a new footprint library. After wiring the schematic, I added the rotary encoder to the PCB. With that finished, I changed the pins for the rows and columsn to make the routing easier and fixed all the DRC errors. I added a rough board outline for the finished PCB and now I have to move to CAD for the plate and case.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzA1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2e3082d837a27b3c94ab795af0eccd236e82b7bd/image.png)
