## 10/30/2025 - Created matrix in schematic.  

Started project by making the schematic file. Created the switch matrix and started assigning footprints for switches with gateron hotswap sockets and sod123 diodes.

## 10/31/2025 - Created KiCad PCB, added a rotary encoder  

I moved schematic into a pcb. Using kb placer. After creating a 3x3 matrix of the keys and routing them, I realized I had more pins I could use. I added a new rotary encoder switch to the matrix, making a 4th column. This required me to download a new footprint library. After wiring the schematic, I added the rotary encoder to the PCB. With that finished, I changed the pins for the rows and columsn to make the routing easier and fixed all the DRC errors. I added a rough board outline for the finished PCB and now I have to move to CAD for the plate and case.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzA1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2e3082d837a27b3c94ab795af0eccd236e82b7bd/image.png)
  

## 11/2/2025 - Fixed pin layouts and routing  

First, I realigned all the diodes as they were misaligned to each other, causing unnecessary trace length. Then, I changed the pins for the rotary encoder as it made the routing easier. this also removed the need to have vias. Then, I unrouted a large chunk of the traces connecting to the mcu as they were too close for the tolerances of JLC.Finally, I added the wooper image on the silkscreen for fun. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--784219dbc8fb8076ceadf337633787c535ec47ef/image.png)
  

## 11/6/2025 9:13 AM - More PCB fixes and CAD  

First, I realized that I used a RP2040 Matrix instead of a RP2040 Pro Micro, so I changed the PCB and rerouted a bit to accommodate. Then, I created a basic plate and case in Fusion 360 because the switches are hotswap. I may need to redesign a bit when I get the PCB, but it should be mostly done.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODkyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--afd4517f4f478f3554bed0f29d690ebb332d41fb/image.png) ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODkyNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ad56eadea65eb1f7f875c63e4d1043b037d03cc1/image.png)

## 11/7/2025 - Created basic firmware and  BOM  

I made a quick and basic QMK firmware code that just has basic keypresses, rotary encoder, and a single layer. This will be changed and fixed after I build the board. I also made a bill of materials csv file. Also fixed column pin being on 3v3 instead of a gpio. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTMyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e1de16feea0e7eb9b7f0b27203c12d4ffaf0d548/image.png)
  

## 11/8/2025 - Fix case  

I modified the case to have a lip that is enough for the bottom of the switches to not hit the bottom and clack. The original case was made by increasing the outer offset from the plate and extruding it to around 25mm.
